# Padel CV System — Build Guide (for Claude / future sessions)

Real-time computer-vision system for a padel court at **InMobiles Holding** (Mkalles,
Lebanon). Two fixed Hikvision cameras, each covering 50–60% of a 20 m × 10 m court
with overlap around the net; that overlap is what resolves the occlusion a single
camera cannot. Built **accuracy-first**, one ordered step at a time.

Authoritative spec: `PadelCV_Roadmap_StepByStep (2).pdf` / `.docx` in the project
root. Read it before changing architecture.

## HARD RULES (never violate)
- **Two cameras everywhere.** No single-camera path. `config.json` must define
  exactly 2 cameras; `main.py` runs one capture/inference thread per camera in
  parallel + a coordinator (from Step 6).
- **Tracker is Deep-EIoU (+ OSNet ReID).** Never ByteTrack. One tracker instance
  per camera.
- **Action recognition is a TRAINED neural network** (LSTM → ST-GCN) over
  normalized 30-frame × 17-keypoint windows. **No rule-based action logic.**
- **Court ROI is an auto-detected, EDITABLE polygon.** Players are kept only if
  their FEET (ankle midpoint; fallback bbox bottom-center) are inside it.
- **Homography maps to the REAL padel-court layout** (sidelines, service lines,
  center service line, net). Both cameras use the **same shared reference points**.
- **Config-driven only.** No hardcoded paths/IPs in code — everything in
  `config.json`.
- **One step at a time.** Build a step, stop, let the user run + verify against the
  step's checklist, then continue. Do not build ahead.

## Tech stack (Section 2 of the spec)
- Detection + skeleton: **YOLOv11-Pose** (`ultralytics`, `yolo11n-pose.pt`) — bbox
  + 17 COCO keypoints.
- Tracking: **Deep-EIoU** (`boxmot` or the `hsiangwei0903/Deep-EIoU` repo) + **OSNet**
  ReID (`torchreid`).
- Identity: OSNet embeddings + jersey color (HSV) + court homography.
- Actions: LSTM → ST-GCN (MMAction2). Ball: MOG2 → custom YOLO → TrackNet.
- Video/geometry: `opencv-python`, `numpy`. Reports: `fpdf2` + JSON. Optional web:
  `flask`. Edge: NVIDIA Jetson + TensorRT (`.engine`).

## Config keys (Section 3.3)
`cameras` (exactly 2; each has `source`, `coverage` 'left'/'right', `court_polygon`,
`homography`, `calibration`), `court_real_size` [20,10], `net_x`, `overlap_zone`,
`tracker` ('deep_eiou'), `reid_weights`, `model` (`yolo11n-pose.pt` or `.engine`),
`detection` (conf/iou/device/imgsz), `display`. During dev, camera `source` points
at local clips; in production it is the RTSP URL.

## Build progress
- **Step 1 — Dual-Camera Capture & Detection — DONE.** Two threads, YOLOv11-Pose,
  COCO-17 skeleton + FPS HUD, dev sources = `side1-1m.mp4` / `side2-1m.mp4`.
- **Step 2 — Court Polygon + Foot Filter — DONE.** `utils/court_roi.py`: auto-detect
  a court-polygon guess per camera (gray-surface contour, trapezoid fallback — single
  -frame color seg is unreliable on this night court, so the editable step is the real
  fit), `--setup-court` click-drag editor saves to `cameras[].court_polygon`, and the
  pipeline keeps a player only if their FEET (ankle midpoint / bbox bottom-center) are
  inside. With no polygon set, all detections are kept (no regression).
- **Step 3 — Deep-EIoU Tracking (+ OSNet ReID) — DONE.** Vendored Deep-EIoU in
  `core/trackers/` (STrack + BoT-SORT Kalman + ExpansionIoU iterative scale-up
  e=0.7/0.8 + BYTE high/low split + ReID fusion `min(iou,emb)`), one tracker per
  camera via `core/tracker.py`. OSNet ReID via boxmot (`utils/reid.py`, default
  `osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt`, auto-downloaded). Stable per-ID color (`utils/colors.py`).
  Thresholds tuned for this dim footage and exposed in `config.json.tracker_params`
  (`new_track_thresh` lowered to 0.5 — players run ~0.6-0.85 conf; `track_buffer` 60
  so a briefly-lost player recovers their ID instead of spawning a new one). Per-camera
  `max_players` cap (config, default 4) keeps the most-established tracks. Single tracker
  display window (both feeds tiled — user preference). IDs are per-camera here; the same
  player gets one ID PER camera — that's unified into one global ID, and the global
  4-player cap enforced, by fusion in Step 6 (needs Step 5 shared-court homography first).
- Steps 4–11: not started (stubs in place). Next: Step 4 (jersey color + enrollment).

## How to run
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt      # includes boxmot (OSNet ReID + lapx)
python main.py --setup-court   # Step 2: drag court corners per camera, S=save
python main.py --show          # 'q' or ESC to quit
```
`yolo11n-pose.pt` + the OSNet ReID weights auto-download on first run. CPU is the
default device (`detection.device` in config) — set to `cuda` if a GPU is available.
On CPU the dual stream + ReID is slow (~1-3 FPS); that is expected (Jetson/TensorRT
is Step 11). Set `"use_reid": false` to run Deep-EIoU motion-only (still not ByteTrack).

## Verify checklists
Step 1: two feeds play in parallel; every player has a bbox + 17-joint skeleton;
an FPS counter shows per stream (top-left HUD).
Step 2: `--setup-court` shows an auto polygon as a starting guess, dragging a corner
saves to config, and on `--show` only players whose feet are inside the polygon are
kept (off-court people draw as a thin gray box); HUD shows `on-court: k/n`.
Step 3: each feed shows stable per-player IDs (colored box + `ID n` + skeleton) that
don't flicker; IDs are per-camera (both feeds number from 1 independently); note any
net-exchange ID swaps — those are fixed by fusion in Step 6. Verified headless: cam1
2 players → IDs [1,2] stable / 40 frames, cam2 3 players → [1,2,3] stable / 30 frames.
